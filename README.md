# LingRex: Linguistic Reconstruction with LingPy

LingRex offers the code needed for the automatic inference of sound correspondence patterns as described in the following paper:

> List, J.-M. (2019): Automatic inference of sound correspondence patterns across multiple languages. Computational Linguistics 45.1. 137-161. 

To test this workflow, please check the workflow code example in `tests/workflows/list-2019`.

When using this package in your research, please make sure to quote the paper accordingly, and quote the software package as follows:

> List, Johann-Mattis (2021): LingRex: Linguistic reconstruction with LingPy. Version 1.0.0. Leipzig: Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. URL: https://github.com/lingpy/lingrex

Since this software package itself makes use of LingPy's alignment algorithms, you should also quote the LingPy package itself.

> List, J.-M. and R. Forkel (2021): LingPy. A Python library for quantitative tasks in historical linguistics. Version 2.6.7. Version 2.6.7. Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology: Leipzig. https://lingpy.org

## Installation

Install the package via `pip`:

```shell
pip install lingrex
```

## Further Examples

In addition to the paper in which the correspondence pattern inference algorithm was first introduced, LingRex also offers the code to compute the workflow described in the following paper:

> Wu, M.-S., N. Schweikhard, T. Bodt, N. Hill, and J.-M. List (2020): Computer-Assisted Language Comparison. State of the Art. Journal of Open Humanities Data 6.2. 1-14. https://doi.org/10.5334/johd.12

To test this workflow, please check the workflow code example in `tests/workflows/wu-2020`. 

If you use this workflow in your work, please quote this paper as well.

In addition, our experiment (with T. Bodt) on predicting words with the help of sound correspondence patterns also made use of the LingRex package.

To test this workflow, please check the workflow code example in `tests/workflows/bodt-2019`.
